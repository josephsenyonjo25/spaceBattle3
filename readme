This is a space battle game using OOP, loops and functions. It is programmed for, and played in the console. The earth has been attacked by a horde of aliens! You are the captain of the USS Schwarzenegger on a mission to destroy all the alien ships with lasers. There are six alien ships. The aliens send one attack ship at a time, and wait to see the outcome of the battle before deploying another alien ship. If the ship survives, it attacks you, if you survive, you attack the ship again- If it survives, it attacks you again, etc.. If you destroy the ship, you have the option to attack the next ship or to retreat. If you retreat, the game is over. You win the game if you destroy all the aliens. You lose the game if you are destroyed.

Ship properties: Hull--same as hitpoints. If hull reaches '0' or less, the ship is destroyed. Firepower is the amount of damage done to the hull of the target with a successful hit. Accuracy is the chance between 0 and 1 that the ship will hit its target. Everytime the ship will attack, calculate the chance that the damage will hit the opposing ship using 'Math.random()' -- if the ship's accuracy is '0.8' -- then if the number generated from 'Math.random() is less than or equal to '0.8' then the attack will be successful. If the value is greater than '0.8' then the attack has missed. Adjust the accuracy based on the specs of each ship. Your spaceship, the USS Schwarzeneggershould have the following properties: hull-'20'; firepower - '5'; accuracy - '.7'. The alien ships should each have the following_ranged_properties determined randomly: hull - between '3' and '6'; firepower - between '2' and '4'; accuracy - between '.6' and '.8'. You could be battling six alienships each with unique values. Example use of accuracy to determine a hit: if (Math.random()< alien[0].accuracy) {console.log('You have been hit!')}
